    "Ans:\n",
    "Code Maintainability:\n",
    "1.Modularity: Encapsulation allows bundling data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together within a class. \n",
    "This promotes modular code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and update. Changes to the implementation within a class don't necessarily affect other parts of the program, as long as the class's interface (public methods) remains consistent\n",
    "2.Abstraction: By exposing only necessary functionalities through public methods while hiding internal implementation details, encapsulation allows developers to work at higher levels of abstraction. This abstraction simplifies the understanding of \n",
    "how a class should be used without needing to know its internal complexities.\n",
    "3.Ease of Refactoring: Encapsulation provides a clear boundary around class attributes, making it easier to refactor or optimize the internal implementation without affecting the rest of the codebase. This is particularly useful in large projects where\n",
    "changes need to be made without causing ripple effects throughout the system.\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "1.Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows control over access to the internal data of a class. \n",
    "By defining attributes as private and providing getter and setter methods, a class can enforce rules and validations for data access and modification\n",
    "2.Data Integrity: With encapsulation, data integrity can be maintained by controlling how data is modified. Setter methods can include validation logic\n",
    "to ensure that only valid data is accepted, preventing the introduction of incorrect or inconsistent values.\n",
    "3.Reduced Side Effects: Encapsulation minimizes unexpected side effects by limiting direct access to class attributes. By using getter and setter methods,\n",
    "the class can manage state changes, reducing the chances of unexpected modifications and potential bugs."
